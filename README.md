UR1. I would like to see a list of dishes with prices <br />
UR2. I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes <br />
UR3. I would like to check the total matches the sum of the various dishes <br />
UR4. I would like to receive a confirmation text <br />

Hints on functionality to implement:

Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices <br />
Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. <br />
If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52". <br />
The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free. <br />
Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API <br />
Use the Gemfile to manage your gems <br />
Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run <br />
However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent <br />


Advanced:  Implement the ability to place orders via text message.  A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
